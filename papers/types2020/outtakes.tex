%% co-induction (as well as induction: see
%% \cite{baelde12tocl,momigliano12jal}) whereas the treatment of
%% coinduction within type theory remains more challenging and is well
%% developed only for various syntactic conditions (see, for example,
%% \cite{bertot08entcs}).

%% The following paragraph seems out-of-place so I delete it now.

%% In this paper, we shall use two different proof systems.  The first
%% logic is first-order intuitionistic logic.  Here, predicates
%% are not inductively defined and quantification will be limited to
%% range over first-order term.  Actually, we shall examine only the Horn
%% clause fragment of that logic.
%% %
%% The second logic will allow for inductively defined predicates using a
%% fixed point notation.   Given again our restriction to essentially
%% Horn clause specifications, it is possible to view intuitionistic
%% reasoning with such specification as if they are actually
%% specification in $\mu$MALL, an extension of multiplicative additive
%% linear logic with the least and greatest fixed point operators
%% \cite{baelde12tocl,baelde07lpar,heath19jar}.

The notion of \emph{focused proof systems}~\cite{andreoli92jlc,liang09tcs}
generalizes this view of proof construction by identifying the
following two phases. % of proof construction.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \emph{negative}%
% \footnote{The terminology of negative and positive phases is a bit
%   unfortunate: historically, these terms do not refer to positive or negative
%   subformula occurrences but rather to certain semantic models used in
%   the study of linear logic~\cite{girard87tcs}.}
%
  phase corresponds to  goal-reduction: in this phase,
  inference rules that involve \emph{don't-care-non\-de\-ter\-min\-ism} are
  applied.
%
  As a result, there is no need to consider backtracking over choices
  made in building this phase.

\item The \emph{positive} phase corresponding to  backchaining: in this phase, inference rules that involve
  \emph{don't-know-non\-de\-ter\-min\-ism} are applied: here,
  inference rules need to be supplied with information in order to
  ensure that a completed proof can be built.
%
  That information can be items such as which term is needed to
  instantiate a universally quantified formula and which disjunct of a
  disjunctive goal formula should be proved.
\end{enumerate}
%
Thus, when building a proof tree (in the sequent calculus) from the
conclusion to its leaves, the negative phase corresponds to a simple
computation that needs no external information, while the positive
phase may need such external information to be supplied.
%
In the literature, it is common to refer to a repository of such
external information as either an \emph{oracle} or a \emph{proof
certificate}.
