                  evidence, in terms of proof, for the truth or
                  falsity of an answer derived by tabled
                  evaluation. The evidence is most easily constructed
                  by post-processing the memo tables created during
                  query evaluation. In this paper we introduce online
                  justification, based on program transformation, to
                  efficiently construct the evidence during query
                  evaluation, while adding little overhead to the
                  evaluation itself. Apart from its efficiency, online
                  justification separates evidence generation from
                  exploration thereby providing flexibility in
                  exploring the evidence either declaratively or
                  procedurally. We present experimental results
                  obtained on examples that construct large evidences
                  which demonstrate the scalability of online
                  justification.",
