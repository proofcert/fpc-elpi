\section{Conclusion and future work}


A mention to the use of \emph{delays} in \texttt{check}: instead of generating only ground terms, we could generate say lists with at least two elements as \texttt{[1;2|Tail]} or simply not commit to a base type. This  is similar to the use of needed narrowing in LazySmallCheck to generate partial trace or the idea of using CLP for data generation (see Dubois' FocalTest or the stuff by Fabio Fioravanti).
