\begin{itemize}
\item Brief discussion/comparison with \texttt{auto}
\item Mention other papers by Enrico as applications of coq-elpi~\cite{coen19mscs,tassi19itp}\dots
\item Say we \textbf{do} not talk about Coq metaprogramming (Ltac, Mtac), do say that doing our to application in MetaCoq~\cite{sozeau2020metacoq} would be a disaster (reimplement unfication, backtracking, binders)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future work}
\label{ssec:fut}


A mention to the use of \emph{delays} in \texttt{check}: instead of generating only ground terms, we could generate say lists with at least two elements as \texttt{[1;2|Tail]} or simply not commit to a base type. This  is similar to the use of needed narrowing in LazySmallCheck to generate partial trace or the idea of using CLP for data generation (see Dubois' FocalTest or~\cite{FioravantiPS15}).

Extending our tactic to handle computations (\texttt{simp})
