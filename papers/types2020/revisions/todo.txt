- cleanup of the code:

-- README.md for code to be updated (the existing one refers to the ijcar subsmission)

-- keep the dir structure? the kernel is under pbt, not ideal.

-- the code right now does not coincide with what is in the paper; e.g. the kernel has
additional clauses (forall right, a clause with constraints). The prod expert does not collect the term etc. 

- paper -

-- we have to add DOI to bib entries




 R1:
  An introduction to the topic, or at
least a section explaining the application in the paper, would be
necessary to open the paper to a larger audience. However, that
requires space. Personally, I would suggest the authors to sacrifice
part of Section 2 for this.
[TODO DALE]



-----------------------------------------------
R1
you are re-implementing a better eauto. However, your
implementation only applies as lemmas constructors of an inductive type.
Note: I understand, because I know it in advance, that a reason could be
that you plan to use LP negation as failure in the later section on testing.
Therefore you need a close world specification. If that's the main reason,
it should be made explicit in the paper.

[AM: I don't think that's it. If i have an inductive predicate p and then prove a lemma about p, this does not violate the CWA, since, well, the lemma is true in the same least model of p]

NEW

-- if we get the tactics to work with Hints, we need a new decide rule
   (or change the one we have).
