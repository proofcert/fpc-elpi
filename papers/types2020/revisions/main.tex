\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The \emph{foundational proof certificate} (FPC) framework is capable
of checking and elaborating a wide range of proof evidence and can easily
be implemented using the logic programming language \lP.
We use the recently released Coq-Elpi plugin for Coq in which the Elpi
implementation of \lP can send and retrieve information to and from the Coq kernel.
We provide two examples: first we implement a FPC-driven sequent calculus for a fragment of the Calculus of Inductive Constructions and we package it into a tactic to perform property-based testing of Inductive types corresponding to pure (higher-order) Horn programs. Secondly, we implement a proof checker for first-order LJF to demonstrate how  proof certificates
can be supplied by external (to Coq) provers and elaborated into the
fully detailed proof terms that can be checked by the Coq kernel.
