some benchmarks for coinductive PBT
=========================================
first-order

ccs.thm		some things that don't hold in CCS

%% 1. there is a p s.t. (p | p) (not ~) to p 
%% 2. there are p,q such that p < q and q < p, but not p ~ q

 [could try this in swi-prolog via coinductive.pl and maybe tor for
 iterative deepening]

higher-order
	
coeval.thm	Leroy's failure of determinism in coeval

		(that may be other stuff in Leroy's paper which holds
		classically but not constructively: does it apply?)
		
asim/		two terms that are ground but not applicatively similar

----------------------
TODO

so many things ...

Things we know fail:
- ccs: weak but not stong bisimilar: tau.a.0 and a.0

- pi-calc:

-- early late bisim not preserved by inputs,

-- ground bisim non a congruence

-- g bisim not preserved by name substitution

let P = overline{x} | y
    Q = overline{x}.y + y.overline{x}
    ~g is ground bisimulation

then P ~g Q but not (P[x/y] ~g Q[x/y])
