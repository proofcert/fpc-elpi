This folder should contain only pure lambda Prolog code relative to FPCs (that is, without references to Coq-Elpi). Currently the only exception is coq-fpc.mod, a file still under work that contains some example of translating terms to and from Coq.
A foreseable exception is an FPC specification of Coq terms.
